My name is Alexander and I am very interested in all things relating to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. 

I am persuing Engineering as a career, and my goal is to enter the [Mechatronics Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/mechatronics-engineering) program at the University of Waterloo.

I created this website to demonstrate my abilites in engineering, and how I can apply them to the projects I work on. Astrophotography is a hobby of mine, and I have found myself engineering many parts to improve the results of my images that I take.
