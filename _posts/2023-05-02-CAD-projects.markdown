# Right Angle CV Joint

![Joint](/assets/hobsonjoint.jpg)

This was a project I designed in my grade 11 Technological Design class. I used Autodesk Fusion 360 to design a device that can remove a lightbulb mounted vertically on a wall. First I thought of a way to transfer torque at a right angle when I ended up finding the [Hobson's Joint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobson%27s_joint#/media/File:ElbowEngine.gif) online. I created my own version of this joint to work in my design.

# Cottage Design

This is a project I did in my grade 10 Technological Design class using Autodesk Revit 2021. I created a model of a cottage from scratch though a 4 step process. First I drew plans on paper, then I modeled the plans in CAD, then I printed two-dimensional views onto foamboard where I cut the foamboard into pieces and created the physical model.

# Bahtinov Mask

This is a project I did on my own for astrophotography. It is a mask that is placed over the apeture of the telescope to assist in focusing. It allows me to focus my telescope much more accurately than without it resulting in more detailed final images. The image on the bottom left is with the Bahtinov mask on, showing that the telescope is out of focus. The image on the bottom right shows the telescope is perfectly in focus.

# Kitchen Design

This was a project I did in my grade 11 Technological Design class. I used Autodesk Revit 2021 to design a kitchen from scratch. I printed two-dimensional views of the design onto paper where I cut foamboard into the design I created on the software.
